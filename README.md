# UWB-and-IMU-Fusion
This is a very high-precision integrated navigation software based on IMU and UWB using MATLAB. In this program, measurements of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) are simulated and used to calculate the positions of the robots moving along a given path. The angle and position errors of the robot are also calculated to show the performance.

# Get started
To run this software, please run the `IMUandUWB.m` in MATLAB.
